I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering
at University of Southern California (USC) in December 2023, supervised by 
[Prof. C.-C. Jay Kuo](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Kuo/Chung-Chieh){:target="_blank"}.
I am proud to be the 171st Ph.D. from
[Media Communication Lab](https://mcl.usc.edu/){:target="_blank"}!
Prior to joining USC as a Ph.D. student, I received my B.S. in 
Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University in 2018, 
and M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from USC in 2019.

As a way to give back to the community and promote diversity,
I am holding AI/ML office hours every week for students 
interested in learning AI/ML knowledge or conducting AI/ML 
research to chat on exciting topics. Priority is given to the 
underrepresented group in engineering. Please use the link to 
sign up: https://forms.gle/McNSxmW94hsL8KEW8.

I am interested in diverse fundamental knowledge graph (KG)
research, including KG completion, KG representation 
learning, and combing KGs with large language models (LLMs) 
for interpretable and efficient reasoning. 
My primary emphasis lies in the development of lightweight and 
transparent machine learning (ML) models.

Recently, my research has been dedicated to the advancement of 
generative AI (GenAI) services within an 
edge-cloud computing paradigm. The objective is to enhance
user privacy, minimize inference time, optimize power efficiency, 
and facilitate computation offloading in the context of scaled AI systems.
