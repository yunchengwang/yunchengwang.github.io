I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering
at University of Southern California, supervised by 
[Prof. C.-C. Jay Kuo](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Kuo/Chung-Chieh){:target="_blank"}
in [Media Communication Lab](https://mcl.usc.edu/){:target="_blank"}. 
Prior to joining USC as a Ph.D. student, I received my B.S. in 
Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University in 2018, 
and M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from USC in 2019.

I have worked on various knowledge graph (KG) research topics, including 
KG completion, KG representation learning, and combing KGs with LLMs. 
Specifically, I focus on developing lightweight and transparent
ML models.
Recently, I am working on scaling generative AI services under an 
edge-cloud computing paradigm to improve user privacy, and time and 
computation efficiency.

***I am actively looking for a faculty or a full-time
research scientist position.***
