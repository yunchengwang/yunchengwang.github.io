I am currently a research scientist at Yahoo Research under the search science team.
I primarly work on query understanding and whole-page optimization to enhance
user engagaement and search experience for 900M monthly active users.
As a machine learning engineer and researcher, I am devoted to developing efficient, 
lightweight, and scalable systems.

Prior to joining Yahoo Research. I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical and 
Computer Engineering from University of Southern California (USC) in 
2023, and my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan
University (NTU) in 2019. 

I am proud to be the 171st Ph.D. from the
[Media Communication Lab](https://mcl.usc.edu/){:target="_blank"} led by 
[Prof. C.-C. Jay Kuo](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Kuo/Chung-Chieh){:target="_blank"}, and a part of the
[mathematical genealogy project](https://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=305226){:target="_blank"}.

I am interested in diverse fundamental knowledge graph (KG)
research, including KG completion, KG representation 
learning, and combining KGs with large language models (LLMs) 
for fact-grounded reasoning. 
<!-- My primary emphasis lies in the development of lightweight and 
transparent machine learning (ML) models. -->

<!-- Recently, my research has been dedicated to the advancement of 
generative AI (GenAI) services within an 
edge-cloud computing paradigm. The objective is to enhance
user privacy, minimize inference time, optimize power efficiency, 
and facilitate computation offloading in the context of scaled AI systems. -->
