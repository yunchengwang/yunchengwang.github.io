I am a senior machine learning engineer at Apple developing Siri. 
Previously, I was a research scientist at Yahoo, focusing on query understanding and knowledge graphs.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University 
of Southern California (USC) in 2023, and my B.S. in Electrical Engineering 
from National Taiwan University (NTU) in 2019. 

I am proud and fortunate to be the 171st Ph.D. from the
[Media Communication Lab](https://mcl.usc.edu/){:target="_blank"} led by 
[Prof. C.-C. Jay Kuo](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Kuo/Chung-Chieh){:target="_blank"}, and to be a part of the
[mathematics genealogy project](https://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=305226){:target="_blank"}.

I am devoted to developing efficient, lightweight, and scalable machine learning
solutions to various different tasks.
Particularly, I focus on diverse fundamental knowledge graph (KG)
research, including KG completion, KG representation 
learning, and combining KGs with large language models (LLMs) 
for fact-grounded reasoning.
