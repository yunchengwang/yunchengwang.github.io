I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering
at University of Southern California, supervised by 
[Prof. C.-C. Jay Kuo](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Kuo/Chung-Chieh){:target="_blank"}
in [Media Communication Lab](https://mcl.usc.edu/){:target="_blank"}. 
Prior to joining USC as a Ph.D. student, I received my B.S. in 
Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University in 2018, 
and M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from USC in 2019.

I am interested in diverse fundamental knowledge graph (KG)
research, including KG completion, KG representation 
learning, and combing KGs with large language models (LLMs) 
for interpretable and efficient reasoning. 
My primary emphasis lies in the development of lightweight and 
transparent machine learning (ML) models.

Recently, my research has been dedicated to the advancement of 
generative artificial intelligence (AI) services within an 
edge-cloud computing paradigm. The objective is to enhance
user privacy, minimize inference time, optimize power efficiency, 
and facilitate computation offloading in the context of scaled AI systems.
