I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering
at University of Southern California, supervised by 
[Prof. C.-C. Jay Kuo](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Kuo/Chung-Chieh)
in [Media Communication Lab](https://mcl.usc.edu/). 
Prior to joining USC as a Ph.D. student, I received my B.S. in 
Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University in 2018, 
and M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from USC in 2019.

I am actively looking for research intern positions for Summer 2023.
My research interests include 
Knowledge Graphs (KG), Natural Language Processing (NLP), 
Perceptual Quality Assessment, Representation Learning, and 
Lightweight Machine Learning Models.
