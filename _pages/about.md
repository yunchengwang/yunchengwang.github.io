I am an ECE Ph.D. student at USC, supervised by Prof. [C.-C. Jay Kuo](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Kuo/Chung-Chieh). I am fortunate and grateful to join USC Media Communication Lab ([MCL](http://mcl.usc.edu/)) to work with a group of talented scholars.


Prior to joining USC as a Ph.D. student, I received my B.S. degree from National Taiwan University in 2018, and M.S. degree from USC in 2019, both in Electrical Engineering.


My research interests include Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and Representation Learning. I am eager to explore how data science could benefit human society.
